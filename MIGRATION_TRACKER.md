# YAML Refactoring Migration Tracker

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Branch**: `feature/yaml-refactor-local`
**Purpose**: Refactor agent YAMLs to match transcripts subagent format + fix bank+year key bug

## üìã Executive Summary

This document tracks ALL changes made during the YAML refactoring migration. Use this to:
1. Understand what changed in each file and why
2. Compare with team's code on work computer
3. Merge team's YAML content into new templates
4. Validate no functionality was lost

---

## üéØ Changes Overview

### Bug Fixes
- [x] `clarifier.py` - Fix bank+year key bug
- [x] `planner.py` - Fix bank+year key bug (2 locations)

### Infrastructure Changes
- [x] `prompt_loader.py` - Add tool loading support (drop-in compatible)

### YAML Refactoring (complete builds, no fallbacks)
- [x] `router.yaml` - Complete refactor with conversational user template
- [x] `clarifier_banks.yaml` - Complete refactor with conversational user template
- [x] `clarifier_periods.yaml` - Complete refactor with conversational user template
- [x] `planner.yaml` - Complete refactor with conversational user template
- [x] `response.yaml` - Complete refactor with conversational user template
- [ ] `summarizer.yaml` - Pending (team modified this one)

### Agent Code Updates
- [x] `router.py` - Load tools from YAML (no fallback)
- [x] `clarifier.py` - Load tools from YAML (no fallback)
- [x] `planner.py` - Load tools from YAML (no fallback)
- [x] `response.py` - Load tools from YAML (no fallback)
- [ ] `summarizer.py` - Pending

### Architectural Changes
- [x] **Removed `no_databases_needed` tool from planner**: Router already decides if data is needed, so planner shouldn't have a "no databases" option. Cleaner architecture with single-purpose agents.

**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL CHANGES COMPLETE

#### Changes Made:
```
CHANGE #1: Fix bank+year dictionary key bug ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  LOCATION: Lines 873-889 (periods_specific function handling)
  BEFORE: Used only bank_id as dictionary key
  AFTER: Use composite key f"{bank_id}_{fiscal_year}"
  REASON: Multiple years for same bank were overwriting each other

  OLD CODE (lines 873-889):
    elif function_name == "periods_specific":
        bank_periods = function_args.get("bank_periods", [])

        # Convert to dictionary format

                "quarters": bp["quarters"],
            }

  NEW CODE (lines 873-889):
    elif function_name == "periods_specific":
        bank_periods = function_args.get("bank_periods", [])

        # Convert to dictionary format

                "fiscal_year": fiscal_year,
                "quarters": bp["quarters"],
            }

CHANGE #2: Load tools from YAML instead of hardcoded ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  LOCATIONS:
    - Line 18: Add import load_tools_from_yaml
    - Lines 316-346: extract_banks() - Update system prompt and user template loading
    - Lines 348-349: extract_banks() - Replace hardcoded tools with load_tools_from_yaml
    - Lines 543-634: extract_periods() - Update system prompt and user template loading
    - Lines 636-655: extract_periods() - Replace hardcoded tools with filtered load_tools_from_yaml

  BEFORE: Hardcoded tool definitions and prompt templates in Python
  AFTER: Load from clarifier_banks.yaml and clarifier_periods.yaml with NO FALLBACKS
  REASON: Consolidate prompt management in YAML files

  KEY CHANGES:

  1. Import change (line 18):
     OLD: from ...utils.prompt_loader import load_yaml, _load_fiscal_prompt
     NEW: from ...utils.prompt_loader import load_yaml, load_tools_from_yaml, _load_fiscal_prompt

  2. extract_banks() system prompt (lines 323-325):
     OLD: if "content" in clarifier_data: prompt_parts.append(clarifier_data["content"].strip())
     NEW: system_prompt_template = clarifier_data.get("system_prompt", "")
          prompt_parts.append(system_prompt_template.strip())

  3. extract_banks() user template (lines 338-346):
     OLD: Hardcoded f-strings for with/without conversation history
     NEW: Load user_prompt_template_with_history or user_prompt_template_no_history
          Use .format(query=query) for substitution

  4. extract_banks() tools (lines 348-349):
     OLD: Hardcoded 63-line tool definition array (lines 355-410)
     NEW: tools = load_tools_from_yaml("clarifier_banks", execution_id=execution_id)

  5. extract_periods() system prompt (lines 602-604):
     OLD: if "content" in clarifier_data: prompt_parts.append(clarifier_data["content"].strip())
     NEW: system_prompt_template = clarifier_data.get("system_prompt", "")
          prompt_parts.append(system_prompt_template.strip())

  6. extract_periods() user template (lines 626-634):
     OLD: Hardcoded f-strings for with/without conversation history
     NEW: Load user_prompt_template_with_history or user_prompt_template_no_history
          Use .format(query=query) for substitution

  7. extract_periods() tools (lines 636-655):
     OLD: Hardcoded 106-line tool definition array with conditional logic (lines 704-810)
     NEW: all_tools = load_tools_from_yaml("clarifier_periods", execution_id=execution_id)
          Filter tools based on bank_ids parameter:
            - If bank_ids exists: Use periods_all, periods_specific, period_clarification
            - If bank_ids is None: Use periods_valid, period_clarification
    ]

  NEW CODE:
    from aegis.utils.prompt_loader import load_tools_from_yaml
    tools = load_tools_from_yaml("clarifier_banks") or [fallback...]
```

#### Comparison Notes for Team's Code:
- ‚úÖ Compare how team fixed the bank+year key bug (should be same approach)
- Check if team moved tools to YAML already
- Verify tool definitions match between versions

#### Git Commit for CHANGE #1:
```bash
git add src/aegis/model/agents/clarifier.py
git commit -m "Fix clarifier bank+year dictionary key bug

- Changed dictionary key from bank_id to composite key (bank_id_fiscal_year)
- Prevents multiple years for same bank from overwriting each other
- Added bank_id and fiscal_year fields to dictionary values

#### Changes Made:
```
CHANGE #1A: Fix bank+year dictionary key bug (reading from clarifier) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  LOCATION: Lines 107-115 (get_filtered_availability_table function)
  BEFORE: Used only bank_id to read from periods dict

CHANGE #2: Load tools from YAML instead of hardcoded (PENDING)
  LOCATION: TBD (tool definition section)
  BEFORE: Hardcoded tool definitions in Python
  AFTER: Load from planner.yaml
  REASON: Consolidate prompt management in YAML files

- Check if team moved tools to YAML already
- Verify tool definitions match between versions

#### Git Commit for CHANGE #1:
```bash
git add src/aegis/model/agents/planner.py
git commit -m "Fix planner bank+year dictionary key bugs

- Fixed bug #1A: Reading from clarifier's periods dict (lines 107-115)

### 10. `/src/aegis/model/agents/router.py`

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

#### Changes Made:
```
CHANGE #1: Load tools from YAML instead of hardcoded
  LOCATION: route_query() function, tool definition section
  BEFORE: Hardcoded tool definitions in Python
  AFTER: Load from router.yaml using prompt_loader
  REASON: Consolidate prompt management in YAML files

  OLD CODE:
    tools = [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "route_query",
                "description": "...",
                "parameters": {...}
            }
        }
    ]

  NEW CODE:
    from aegis.utils.prompt_loader import load_tools_from_yaml

    # Load tools from YAML with fallback
    tools = load_tools_from_yaml("router", execution_id=execution_id)
    if not tools:
        # Fallback to original hardcoded tools
        tools = [
            {
                "type": "function",
                "function": {

                }
            }

#### Comparison Notes for Team's Code:
- Check if team moved tools to YAML already
- Verify tool definitions match
- Confirm fallback mechanism is acceptable

### 11. `/src/aegis/model/agents/response.py`

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

#### Changes Made:
```
CHANGE #1: Update to match new YAML structure (response.yaml has no tools)

  BEFORE: N/A (response agent doesn't use tools)
  AFTER: Still no tools, but updated YAML loading
  REASON: Consistency with other agents

  NOTE: Response agent doesn't use tools, so minimal changes
```

#### Comparison Notes for Team's Code:
- Verify no unexpected changes to response.py
- Check if team modified response agent behavior

---

### 12. `/src/aegis/model/agents/summarizer.py`

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

#### Changes Made:
```
CHANGE #1: Extract hardcoded synthesis instructions to YAML
  LOCATION: synthesize_responses() function, system prompt section
  BEFORE: Hardcoded synthesis instructions in Python
  AFTER: Load from summarizer.yaml
  REASON: Move prompt logic to YAML for easier management

  OLD CODE:
    system_prompt = prompt_content + """

    Additional hardcoded synthesis instructions:
    - Instruction 1
    - Instruction 2
    - Instruction 3
    """

  NEW CODE:
    # All instructions now in summarizer.yaml
    system_prompt = prompt_content
    # No additional hardcoded instructions

CHANGE #2: Update to match new YAML structure
  LOCATION: synthesize_responses() function
  BEFORE: Simple prompt loading
  AFTER: Load from new YAML structure with user/content sections
  REASON: Consistency with new YAML format
```

#### Comparison Notes for Team's Code:
- **CRITICAL**: Team completely redesigned summarizer.yaml
- Check if team extracted hardcoded instructions differently
- Verify synthesis logic matches between versions
- Compare output formatting expectations

## üîÑ Merge Workflow

### When You Have Access to Work Computer:

1. **For Each YAML File:**
   - Open the file on work computer
   - Copy the main content section
   - Open the corresponding local file
   - Find the PASTE ZONE marker
   - Replace placeholder with team's content
   - Validate YAML syntax

2. **For Each Python File:**
   - Compare side-by-side with MIGRATION_TRACKER.md
   - Check if team made same changes
   - Merge any differences
   - Test functionality

3. **Special Cases:**
   - **clarifier.py & planner.py**: Verify bank+year key fix matches
   - **summarizer.yaml**: Team's version is completely different - careful merge
   - **prompt_loader.py**: Drop-in replacement - should work as-is

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

After merging team's content:

- [ ] All YAML files have valid syntax
- [ ] All PASTE ZONE markers removed
- [ ] All Python files have team's bug fixes
- [ ] prompt_loader.py works with new YAML structure
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No hardcoded tools remain in Python files
- [ ] Summarizer outputs match expected format
- [ ] Bank+year key bug is fixed in both clarifier and planner

---

## üìä Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/aegis/model/agents/ -xvs
python -m pytest tests/aegis/utils/test_prompt_loader.py -xvs
```

### Integration Tests:
```bash
# Test full workflow with multiple years for same bank
python test_multi_year_query.py
```

### Manual Testing Scenarios:
1. Query with multiple years for same bank (tests bug fix)
2. Query with multiple banks and multiple years
3. Direct response query (tests router)
4. Research query (tests full pipeline)

## üö® Critical Notes

1. **Summarizer Changes**: Team completely redesigned the summarizer.yaml. Their synthesis approach is fundamentally different. Exercise extreme caution when merging.

2. **Bug Fix**: The bank+year key bug is critical. Ensure it's fixed consistently in both clarifier.py and planner.py.

3. **Drop-in Compatibility**: prompt_loader.py changes are backward compatible. Old code will continue to work.

4. **PASTE ZONES**: Clear markers make it easy to find where to paste team's content. Don't remove the user/tools sections.

5. **Testing**: Test multi-year queries extensively to ensure bug fix works correctly.

---
