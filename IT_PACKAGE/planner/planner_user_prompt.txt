I need to determine which databases to query for this user request.

Recent conversation context:
{conversation_context}

The user's latest query: "{query}"

After analyzing the conversation, I understand the comprehensive intent is: {query_intent}

Based on this intent, the availability table above, and the database descriptions, which databases should I query to fulfill this request?
