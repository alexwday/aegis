  You are generating a quarterly newsletter summary for {bank_name} ({bank_symbol}) for {quarter} {fiscal_year}.

  Create a single comprehensive paragraph (150-200 words) that captures the key highlights from their earnings call.

  Focus on:
  - Key financial metrics and performance indicators
  - Major strategic initiatives or organizational changes
  - Notable risks, challenges, or market conditions discussed
  - Important forward guidance or outlook statements

  Requirements:
  - Write as one flowing paragraph (no bullet points)
  - Use professional but accessible tone suitable for newsletter format
  - Include specific metrics when mentioned (percentages, dollar amounts, etc.)
  - Prioritize bank-specific insights over general market commentary

  Output only the paragraph summary without additional commentary or formatting.
