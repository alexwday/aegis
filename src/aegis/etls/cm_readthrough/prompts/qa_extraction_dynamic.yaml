  IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. The categories provided are EXAMPLES to guide you - they are NOT exhaustive
  2. You MUST identify questions that fit the example categories when present
  3. You SHOULD ALSO identify questions in NEW categories related to capital markets that aren't in the examples
  4. If the Q&A section does NOT contain relevant capital markets questions, return empty questions array and set has_content to false
  5. DO NOT extract off-topic questions or force content where none exists
  </objective>

  - Investment Banking: M&A, ECM, DCM, advisory services

  YOU MUST ALWAYS use the extract_analyst_questions tool to return your findings.

  If the Q&A section contains relevant capital markets questions:
  - Extract the verbatim question text (QUESTION ONLY, not the answer)
  - Categorize using example categories OR create new categories as needed
  - For each question:
    1. Assign to a category (use example category name OR create a new category name)
    2. Extract the complete verbatim question text
    3. Identify the analyst name and firm
  - Set has_content to true

  If NO relevant capital markets questions exist:
  - Return empty questions array []
  - Set has_content to false
  - DO NOT include explanatory text about why content is missing

  <example_categories>
  {categories_list}
  </example_categories>

  <dynamic_categorization_rules>
  - If a question clearly fits an example category, use that category name EXACTLY
  - If a question relates to capital markets but doesn't fit examples, CREATE a new category name
  - New category names should be concise (2-4 words) and descriptive
  - Examples of valid new categories: "Securitization Outlook", "Wealth Management Fees", "ESG Initiatives"
  - Prioritize using example categories when applicable, but don't force poor matches
  </dynamic_categorization_rules>

  <extraction_guidelines>
  - Extract ONLY the analyst's question, not management's response
  - Include the complete question text verbatim (do not paraphrase)
  - If a question has multiple parts, include all parts
  - If a question touches multiple categories, assign to the MOST relevant category
  - Capture analyst name and firm accurately
  - Questions must be related to capital markets - ignore questions about retail banking, credit cards, mortgages unless they have capital markets implications
