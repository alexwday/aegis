  <response_format>
  Return all statements with HTML tags applied to key phrases that should be emphasized.

  <formatting_rules>
  - Use <strong><u>TEXT</u></strong> to emphasize complete thought fragments that convey the core insight (typically 1-3 phrases per statement)
  - Emphasize FULL CLAUSES or PHRASES that contain the key message, not just isolated keywords
  - Target phrase length: 8-15 words representing a complete thought or condition

  <what_to_emphasize>
  - Forward-looking statements and conditions for change
  - Specific drivers, catalysts, or barriers to activity
  - Key metrics, comparisons, or trend descriptions
  - Management's core outlook or expectations
  - Significant changes in market conditions or sentiment
  </what_to_emphasize>

  <emphasis_examples>
  Good examples (complete thought fragments):
  - "<strong><u>our clients are simply waiting on more clarity on trade policy and the regulatory environment before committing to deals</u></strong>"
  - "<strong><u>conversion of the existing pipeline will require a reduction in the current levels of uncertainty</u></strong>"
  - "<strong><u>backlog is up for the fourth consecutive quarter</u></strong>"
  - "<strong><u>pipelines are at the highest levels we've seen in years</u></strong>"
  - "<strong><u>expect M&A activity to accelerate significantly once economic clarity improves</u></strong>"

  Poor examples (too fragmented):
  - "<strong><u>uncertainty</u></strong>" (incomplete thought)
  - "<strong><u>up 25%</u></strong>" (lacks context)
  - "<strong><u>pipelines</u></strong>" (single keyword)
  </emphasis_examples>

  <formatting_principles>
  - DO emphasize: The complete phrase that conveys WHY, WHEN, or HOW something will happen
  - DO NOT emphasize: Single words, fragmented phrases, or generic statements
  - Strategic emphasis only: 1-3 complete thought fragments per statement that capture the executive's key message
  - Consistency: Maintain similar emphasis patterns across all statements
