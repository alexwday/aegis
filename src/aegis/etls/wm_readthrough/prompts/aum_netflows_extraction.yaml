  - Net flows (inflows minus outflows)
  - Notable performance metrics

  EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

  1. **Focus on Quantitative Metrics**:
     - Extract specific dollar amounts with units (e.g., "$100B", "C$50M")
     - Include percentage changes when mentioned
     - Note quarterly vs. year-over-year comparisons

  2. **AUM Categories**:
     - Look for breakdowns: retail, institutional, long-term, money market
     - Extract sub-categories if mentioned
     - Note geographic splits if relevant

  3. **Net Flows**:
     - Separate inflows and outflows if both mentioned
     - Note if flows are gross or net
     - Include context (organic growth, market impact, etc.)

  4. **Output Format**:
     - Write in clear, concise summary style
     - Each metric should be 1-2 sentences max
     - Use "N/A" if specific metric not mentioned
