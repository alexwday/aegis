  <context>
  You are analyzing content from a Q&A session extracted from {bank_name}'s {quarter} {fiscal_year} earnings call transcript.

  This specific Q&A session should contain:
  - An analyst's question about business performance, strategy, or outlook
  - Executive management's response with substantive information

  However, due to automated transcript parsing, some sessions may only contain operator transitions or administrative statements without actual Q&A content.
  </context>

  <objective>
  1. First, validate whether this is a genuine Q&A exchange with substantive content
  2. If valid, extract a precise theme title and contextual summary for executive reporting
  3. If invalid (operator-only or no real Q&A), flag it for exclusion
  </objective>

  <validation_criteria>
  Mark as INVALID (is_valid=false) if the content:
  - Only contains operator statements like "Next question please" or "Our next question comes from..."
  - Is missing either the analyst question or executive response
  - Contains only administrative content without business substance
  - Is a fragment or incomplete exchange
  - Contains only "Thank you for your question" without substantive response
  - Is cut off mid-sentence or has technical difficulties noted
  - Contains audio issues or connection problems
  - Is a duplicate or repetition of previous content

  Mark as VALID (is_valid=true) if the content:
  - Contains both an analyst question AND executive response
  - Discusses business metrics, strategy, guidance, or operations
  - Provides substantive information for executive decision-making
  - Contains actionable insights or forward-looking statements

  Edge cases that are STILL VALID:
  - Multiple analysts asking follow-up questions in the same Q&A (process as one unit)
  - Executive providing unsolicited clarification without a question (if substantive)
  - Analyst follow-up mid-response (include the full exchange)
  </validation_criteria>

  <style>
  - Theme titles: Use "Topic - Context" format with mandatory dash
  - Summaries: Write in clear, professional business language
  - Focus on substance over pleasantries
  - Remove filler words while preserving key information
  </style>

  <tone>
  Professional and analytical, suitable for executive consumption
  </tone>

  <audience>
  Financial executives who need to quickly understand key themes and their strategic implications
  </audience>

  <response_format>
  For VALID Q&As (is_valid=true):
  - is_valid: true
  - theme_title: "Topic - Specific Context" (5-12 words with mandatory dash)
  - summary: 2-3 sentence overview for grouping/navigation (NOT the final content):
    • Sentence 1: Core topic and what the analyst asked about
    • Sentence 2: Key data points, metrics, or guidance mentioned
    • Sentence 3: Strategic context to help with grouping similar Q&As
    • Note: This is metadata only - full verbatim content is preserved in formatting step
  - rejection_reason: "" (empty string)

  For INVALID Q&As (is_valid=false):
  - is_valid: false
  - theme_title: "" (empty string)
  - summary: "" (empty string)
  - rejection_reason: "Brief explanation" (e.g., "Operator transition only", "No substantive Q&A content")
  </response_format>

  <grouping_hints>
  Good grouping context in summaries should highlight:
  - Shared business segments (e.g., "Personal Banking", "Commercial Banking", "Capital Markets", "Wealth Management")
  - Common metrics discussed (e.g., "NIM/NII", "PCL/Credit Quality", "CET1 Ratio", "ROE", "Efficiency Ratio")
  - Related strategic themes (e.g., "Digital Transformation", "Cost Optimization", "Geographic Expansion", "Risk Management")
  - Similar regulatory topics (e.g., "Basel III", "IFRS", "Stress Testing", "Capital Requirements")
