  <context>
  You are formatting a Q&A exchange from {bank_name}'s {quarter} {fiscal_year} earnings call for inclusion in an executive briefing document.

  This Q&A has already been validated as containing substantive business content with both an analyst question and executive response. Your task is to apply professional formatting and strategic emphasis.
  </context>

  <objective>
  Transform raw Q&A transcript into polished, executive-ready format with strategic markdown emphasis that:
  1. Highlights key financial metrics and data points
  2. Emphasizes forward-looking guidance and strategic statements
  3. Maintains clear speaker attribution and flow
  4. Removes filler while preserving all substantive content
  </objective>

  <style>
  - Professional business communication for C-suite consumption
  - Clean structure with clear speaker labels
  - Strategic markdown emphasis for quick scanning
  - Preserve exact numbers, dates, and guidance verbatim
  - Remove only: "um", "uh", "you know", pleasantries, repetitions
  </style>

  <tone>
  Executive briefing tone: direct, precise, and professionally polished
  </tone>

  <audience>
  Senior bank executives and board members who need to quickly extract key metrics, guidance, and strategic decisions from earnings discussions
  </audience>

  <emphasis_strategy>
  IMPORTANT: The document processor supports these exact markdown formats:

  ***text*** = Bold + Italic (highest emphasis for critical guidance/outlooks)
  **text** = Bold (financial metrics, numbers, percentages, ratios)
  *text* = Italic (business segments, programs, geographic regions)

  Alternative syntax also supported:
  __text__ = Bold (alternative to **)
  _text_ = Italic (alternative to *)

  Priority for emphasis:
  1. ***Critical forward guidance and strategic announcements***
  2. **Specific numbers, metrics, and quantitative data**
  3. *Business units, initiatives, and named programs*
  </emphasis_strategy>

  <formatting_rules>
  <speaker_format>
  For Analysts:
  [Full Name] ([Firm Name]):
  [Formatted question on new line]

  For Executives:
  [Full Name] ([Title]):
  [Formatted response on new line]

  For multiple executives responding:
  [Name1] ([Title1]):
  [Response1]

  [Name2] ([Title2]):
  [Response2]
  </speaker_format>

  <content_preservation>
  MUST PRESERVE verbatim:
  - All numbers, percentages, ratios, dollar amounts
  - Specific dates, quarters, timeframes
  - Guidance statements and outlooks
  - Technical terms and acronyms
  - Commitments and forward-looking statements

  REMOVE only:
  - Filler words: "um", "uh", "you know", "kind of", "sort of"
  - Opening pleasantries: "Thank you for the question", "Great question"
  - Repetitive phrases that add no value
  - Meta-commentary about the call itself
  </content_preservation>

  <quality_checks>
  Before finalizing, ensure:
  1. Every number/metric is **bolded**
  2. Every forward guidance statement is ***bold+italic***
  3. Business segments and programs are *italicized*
  4. Speaker names and roles are clearly labeled
  5. No substantive information was removed
  6. Formatting enhances readability, not distract from it

  John Smith, Goldman Sachs: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Um, I wanted to ask about, you know, your NIM outlook for next year. Can you give us some color on where you see margins heading given the rate environment? And maybe touch on deposit costs as well?

  Jane Doe, CFO: Thanks John. So on NIM, we're seeing it at around 1.65% for Q4, and we expect it to expand to approximately 1.70% to 1.75% by mid next year as deposit costs normalize. On the deposit side, our costs peaked at 235 basis points last quarter and we're already seeing them come down.

  Mike Johnson from JP Morgan: Could you talk about your capital deployment priorities? I'm particularly interested in buybacks versus organic growth investments.

  Bob Smith, CEO: Sure Mike. Our capital priorities remain consistent. First is organic growth - we're investing about $2 billion annually in technology and digital capabilities. Second is our dividend, which we increased by 8% this quarter. Third is buybacks - we have $5 billion remaining on our current authorization and expect to complete it by year-end. Our CET1 ratio of 13.2% gives us plenty of flexibility here.
