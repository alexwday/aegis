  <context>
  You are formatting a Q&A exchange from {bank_name}'s {quarter} {fiscal_year} earnings call for inclusion in an executive briefing document.

  Your goal is to create a clean, professional document that:
  - Removes conversational fluff and pleasantries
  - Preserves all substantive business content
  - Applies consistent formatting for easy scanning

  CRITICAL: You MUST use HTML tags ONLY. NO markdown formatting.
  ONLY use HTML tags: <b>, <i>, <u>, <span>, <mark>
  </context>

  <objective>
  Transform raw Q&A transcript into polished, executive-ready format:

  CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Two separate tasks:

  TASK 1 - CONTENT CLEANING (what to remove vs keep):
  - REMOVE: "Thanks for taking my question", "Great question", "Thank you", filler words
  - KEEP: Every bit of business substance - questions, answers, data, explanations, reasoning

  TASK 2 - FORMAT FOR EMPHASIS (apply to cleaned content):
  1. Speaker format: <b>Name</b> (Title/Firm): content
  2. Blue larger text: The ONE most important sentence per speaker
  3. Yellow highlight: Game-changing strategic insights only
  4. Bold: ALL numbers, metrics, temporal references
  5. Italic: Business segments/divisions ONLY
  6. Underline: Firm commitments with deadlines ONLY

  REMEMBER: Formatting adds visual emphasis. It does NOT determine what content to include.
  </objective>

  <style>
  - Professional executive briefing format
  - Inline speaker identification with bold names (using HTML <b> tags ONLY)
  - Strategic HTML emphasis for quick scanning (NO MARKDOWN!)
  - Clean, concise language without losing substance
  - Separate paragraphs for visual clarity
  - CRITICAL: Use ONLY HTML tags, NEVER markdown asterisks
  </style>

  <tone>
  Executive briefing: direct, precise, professionally polished
  </tone>

  <audience>
  Senior bank executives and board members requiring quick extraction of metrics, guidance, and strategic decisions
  </audience>

  <formatting_structure>
  CRITICAL: Each speaker must be formatted as a separate paragraph with this exact structure:

  <b>Speaker Name</b> (Title/Firm): Their formatted content with appropriate HTML emphasis tags inline.

  Each new speaker starts a new paragraph. Never put speaker name on a separate line from their content.
  </formatting_structure>

  <emphasis_strategy>
  SIMPLE, CLEAR HTML FORMATTING RULES:

  IMPORTANT: Formatting is for EMPHASIS ONLY. After removing pleasantries/fluff, include ALL remaining business content whether formatted or not.

  1. BLUE LARGER TEXT - Highlight the ONE most important sentence per speaker:
     • QUESTION: <span style="color: #1e4d8b; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;">The analyst's core question sentence</span>
     • ANSWER: <span style="color: #4d94ff; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;">The executive's most direct answer sentence</span>
     Note: Blue formatting is for visual emphasis - include all other business content too

  2. YELLOW HIGHLIGHT - Key strategic statements:
     • <mark style="background-color: #ffff99;">Any game-changing revelation or critical strategic insight</mark>
     • Examples: Major strategic pivots, surprising guidance changes, critical competitive insights

  3. BOLD - Financial data and time references:
     • <b>ALL numbers</b>: 1.65%, $2 billion, 150 branches, Q3, 2025
     • <b>ALL financial metrics</b>: NIM, ROE, CET1, PCL, efficiency ratio
     • <b>ALL temporal references</b>: last quarter, Q3 2024, year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, fiscal 2025, by year-end
     • <b>ALL comparisons</b>: up 10%, down 5 basis points, increased by $2M

  4. ITALIC - Business divisions ONLY:
     • <i>Business segments</i>: Personal Banking, Wealth Management, Capital Markets
     • <i>Product names</i>: specific products or services mentioned
     • <i>Geographic regions</i>: Canadian Banking, US operations

  5. UNDERLINE - Firm commitments ONLY:
     • <u>Specific targets with deadlines</u>: "We will achieve X by Y date"
     • <u>Concrete promises</u>: "We are committed to..."

  SIMPLE PRIORITY ORDER (no complex overlapping):
  - Blue/yellow formatting takes precedence in those specific sentences
  - Otherwise, apply bold to all numbers/metrics/temporal references consistently
  - Apply italic to segments, underline to commitments as they appear

  NEVER USE MARKDOWN:
  ✗ WRONG: **1.65%** or *Personal Banking* or ***anything***
  ✓ CORRECT: <b>1.65%</b> or <i>Personal Banking</i> or proper HTML only
  </emphasis_strategy>

  <content_cleanup_rules>
  WHAT TO REMOVE vs WHAT TO KEEP:

  REMOVE COMPLETELY:
  ✗ Entire speaker turns that are just "Okay, thanks" or "Got it, thank you"
  ✗ Operator statements: "Next question comes from..."
  ✗ Filler words: um, uh, ah, you know (when used as filler)
  ✗ Opening pleasantries: "Thanks for taking my question"
  ✗ Closing pleasantries: "Thank you", "I appreciate it"
  ✗ Standalone acknowledgments: "Right", "Okay", "Yes" (when alone)
  ✗ Meta-references: "Next slide please", "As you see on slide 12"

  KEEP VERBATIM:
  ✓ The actual question being asked (even if multiple parts)
  ✓ The complete answer with all explanations
  ✓ All numbers, data points, and metrics
  ✓ All reasoning and rationale
  ✓ All examples and context that add understanding
  ✓ All forward-looking statements
  ✓ All risk discussions
  ✓ Connective phrases within explanations

  GUIDELINE: If it contains business substance, keep it. If it's just social nicety, remove it.

  DO NOT SUMMARIZE - preserve the executive's complete explanation, just clean up the fluff around it.
  </content_cleanup_rules>

  <output_expectations>
  Your output should be:
  - SHORTER than the input (pleasantries removed)
  - COMPLETE in business substance (all data, reasoning, context preserved)
  - FORMATTED for scanning (HTML emphasis on key elements)
  - PROFESSIONAL in tone (no casual fillers or social niceties)

  Think of it as: Take a 5-minute rambling conversation and turn it into a 3-minute executive briefing that still contains every business fact, just without the "hello, how are you" parts.

  John Smith, Goldman Sachs: Yeah, um, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about, you know, your NIM outlook for next year. Can you give us some color on where you see margins heading given the rate environment? And maybe touch on deposit costs as well? Thank you.

  Jane Doe, CFO: Thanks John. So, um, on NIM, we're seeing it at around 1.65% for Q4, and we expect it to expand to approximately 1.70% to 1.75% by mid next year as deposit costs normalize. We're committed to reaching 1.80% by end of 2025. On the deposit side, our costs peaked at 235 basis points last quarter and we're already seeing them come down, you know, pretty significantly.

  Mike Johnson from JP Morgan: Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about your capital deployment priorities? I'm particularly interested in, um, buybacks versus organic growth investments and any specific targets you have there.

  Bob Smith, CEO: Sure Mike. So our capital priorities remain consistent. First is organic growth - we're investing about $2 billion annually in technology and digital capabilities. Second is our dividend, which we increased by 8% this quarter. Third is buybacks - we have $5 billion remaining on our current authorization and expect to complete it by year-end. Our CET1 ratio of 13.2% gives us plenty of flexibility here. We're targeting a 15% ROE by fiscal 2026.

  Sarah Williams, CFO: And if I can just add to Bob's point - the $2 billion technology investment Bob mentioned, about 60% of that is going toward customer-facing digital platforms and 40% toward infrastructure modernization. We expect this to drive 200 basis points of efficiency ratio improvement over the next three years.

  Sarah Chen, Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you. Can you provide an update on your branch optimization program and the cost savings you're expecting?

  John Williams, COO: Absolutely Sarah. So we're on track with our branch consolidation - we'll close 150 branches this year and another 200 next year. This will generate approximately $400 million in annual cost savings by 2025. We're reinvesting about half of that into our digital channels. Our digital adoption rate has reached 72% which is, you know, ahead of our 70% target for this year.

  David Lee, Barclays: Thanks. Um, could you walk us through your thinking on the provision build this quarter? It seems higher than peers.

  Jane Doe, CFO: Sure, David. So, um, let me give you the full context here because I think it's important to understand our methodology. We took a provision of $850 million this quarter, and there are really three components driving that. First, about $300 million is related to our commercial real estate portfolio, specifically office properties in major urban centers where we're seeing continued stress from work-from-home trends. We've been very conservative here because we think the recovery will be slower than many expect. Second, we have $400 million related to our consumer portfolio, and this is really about normalization - we're still below pre-pandemic levels but we're seeing the expected increase in delinquencies as government support programs have ended. And then the remaining $150 million is what I'd call prudent overlay given the macro uncertainty - we're seeing mixed signals on recession risk and we'd rather be conservative here. Now, if you compare this to peers, you're right that it's higher, but I think you have to look at our mix of business - we have more exposure to commercial real estate than most of our peers, about 15% of our loan book versus 10% industry average, and we've always taken a more conservative approach to provisioning which has served us well historically.

  David Lee: Right, okay, that makes sense. Thanks for that clarification.

  Jane Doe, CFO: And just to add one more point - our coverage ratio is now at 2.8%, which gives us a very strong buffer, and we think that positions us well for whatever economic scenario unfolds.

  Note: The analyst's follow-up "Right, okay, that makes sense. Thanks for that clarification." was removed as it's non-substantive.

  <edge_cases>
  Multiple executives answering:
  - Each gets their own paragraph with bold name
  - Maintain chronological order
  - Don't combine their responses

  Unclear audio:
  - Use [Inaudible] inline where needed
  - Continue formatting the rest

  Already contains HTML:
  - Preserve existing valid HTML tags
  - Don't double-tag content

  Very long responses:
  - Can break into multiple paragraphs for the same speaker
  - Repeat speaker identification if breaking: <b>Jane Doe</b> (CFO) continued: ...

  Interruptions or clarifications:
  - Include both speakers with proper formatting
  - Use natural flow, not timestamps
  </edge_cases>

  <final_reminder>
  CRITICAL BALANCE TO ACHIEVE:
  ✓ REMOVE all pleasantries, thank yous, acknowledgments, filler words
  ✓ PRESERVE all business substance, explanations, data, reasoning

  FORMATTING CHECKS:
  ✓ ALL formatting uses HTML tags (<b>, <i>, <u>, <span>, <mark>)
  ✗ NO markdown formatting (**text**, *text*, ***text***)
  ✓ Numbers are bolded with <b>1.65%</b> NOT **1.65%**
  ✓ Segments are italicized with <i>Personal Banking</i> NOT *Personal Banking*
  ✓ Blue formatting highlights key sentences (others still included)

  CONTENT PRESERVATION:
  ✓ Keep the complete business question (without "thanks for taking my question")
  ✓ Keep the complete business answer (without "thanks John" or "great question")
  ✓ Keep all data, metrics, explanations, context, reasoning
  ✗ Remove "thank you", "I appreciate it", "um", "you know" (as filler)
  ✗ Remove entire speaker turns that are just acknowledgments

  REMEMBER: Clean and format the Q&A for executives - remove social niceties but preserve all business substance.
