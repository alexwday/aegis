  <context>
  You are formatting a Q&A exchange from {bank_name}'s {quarter} {fiscal_year} earnings call for inclusion in an executive briefing document.

  IMPORTANT: This Q&A has already been validated by the theme extraction step as containing substantive business content (is_valid=true). It contains both an analyst question and executive response with business substance.

  Your task is to:
  1. Apply professional formatting with strategic HTML emphasis
  2. Format speakers inline with bold names
  3. Clean up conversational filler while preserving all substantive content verbatim
  4. Create clear paragraph structure for readability
  </context>

  <objective>
  Transform raw Q&A transcript into polished, executive-ready format that:
  1. Uses inline speaker formatting: <b>Name</b> (Title/Firm): content
  2. Highlights key financial metrics with bold tags
  3. Emphasizes forward guidance with bold+italic
  4. Underlines critical commitments and targets
  5. Removes ONLY filler words and acknowledgments while preserving ALL substantive content verbatim
  6. Creates separate paragraphs for each speaker
  7. Maintains complete management explanations with full context and detail
  </objective>

  <style>
  - Professional executive briefing format
  - Inline speaker identification with bold names
  - Strategic HTML emphasis for quick scanning
  - Clean, concise language without losing substance
  - Separate paragraphs for visual clarity
  </style>

  <tone>
  Executive briefing: direct, precise, professionally polished
  </tone>

  <audience>
  Senior bank executives and board members requiring quick extraction of metrics, guidance, and strategic decisions
  </audience>

  <formatting_structure>
  CRITICAL: Each speaker must be formatted as a separate paragraph with this exact structure:

  <b>Speaker Name</b> (Title/Firm): Their formatted content with appropriate HTML emphasis tags inline.

  Each new speaker starts a new paragraph. Never put speaker name on a separate line from their content.
  </formatting_structure>

  <emphasis_strategy>
  HTML tags for strategic emphasis:

  <b>text</b> = Bold (all numbers, metrics, percentages, ratios, dollar amounts)
  <i>text</i> = Italic (business segments, programs, geographic regions)
  <u>text</u> = Underline (firm commitments, specific targets, critical deadlines)
  <b><i>text</i></b> = Bold + Italic (critical forward guidance and strategic announcements)
  <b><u>text</u></b> = Bold + Underline (most important quantified commitments)

  Priority hierarchy:
  1. <b><i>Critical forward-looking guidance</i></b>
  2. <b><u>Firm commitments with specific numbers</u></b>
  3. <u>Important deadlines and targets</u>
  4. <b>All quantitative data</b>
  5. <i>Named initiatives and segments</i>
  </emphasis_strategy>

  <content_cleanup_rules>
  CRITICAL: Management explanations must be preserved VERBATIM. Only remove truly unnecessary elements.

  REMOVE ONLY these specific elements:
  - Filler words: "um", "uh", "ah", "you know" (ONLY when used as filler, not when part of explanation)
  - Opening pleasantries: "Thank you for the question", "Great question", "Thanks for taking my question"
  - Closing pleasantries at end: "Thank you", "I appreciate it", "That's helpful"
  - Acknowledgments: "Right", "Okay", "Yes", "Sure", "Got it", "I see" (when standalone)
  - Verbal tics: "So" or "Well" ONLY at the very start of a response
  - Meta-references: "Next slide please", "As you can see on slide 12"

  PRESERVE EVERYTHING ELSE VERBATIM including:
  - ALL management explanations (full length, exact wording)
  - ALL executive responses (complete thoughts, full context)
  - ALL reasoning and rationale provided
  - ALL examples and illustrations given
  - ALL forward-looking statements
  - ALL risk discussions
  - ALL operational details
  - ALL strategic explanations
  - Connective phrases within explanations (keep "so" if mid-sentence)
  - Clarifying phrases like "I mean" when part of explanation

  DO NOT CONDENSE OR SUMMARIZE:
  - Management responses must maintain their full explanatory content
  - Keep all details, context, and color commentary from executives
  - Preserve the complete narrative and logic flow
  - Maintain all nuance and qualification in responses

  The goal is readability through removing interruptions and filler, NOT brevity through condensing content.

  John Smith, Goldman Sachs: Yeah, um, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about, you know, your NIM outlook for next year. Can you give us some color on where you see margins heading given the rate environment? And maybe touch on deposit costs as well? Thank you.

  Jane Doe, CFO: Thanks John. So, um, on NIM, we're seeing it at around 1.65% for Q4, and we expect it to expand to approximately 1.70% to 1.75% by mid next year as deposit costs normalize. We're committed to reaching 1.80% by end of 2025. On the deposit side, our costs peaked at 235 basis points last quarter and we're already seeing them come down, you know, pretty significantly.

  Mike Johnson from JP Morgan: Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about your capital deployment priorities? I'm particularly interested in, um, buybacks versus organic growth investments and any specific targets you have there.

  Bob Smith, CEO: Sure Mike. So our capital priorities remain consistent. First is organic growth - we're investing about $2 billion annually in technology and digital capabilities. Second is our dividend, which we increased by 8% this quarter. Third is buybacks - we have $5 billion remaining on our current authorization and expect to complete it by year-end. Our CET1 ratio of 13.2% gives us plenty of flexibility here. We're targeting a 15% ROE by fiscal 2026.

  Sarah Williams, CFO: And if I can just add to Bob's point - the $2 billion technology investment Bob mentioned, about 60% of that is going toward customer-facing digital platforms and 40% toward infrastructure modernization. We expect this to drive 200 basis points of efficiency ratio improvement over the next three years.

  Sarah Chen, Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you. Can you provide an update on your branch optimization program and the cost savings you're expecting?

  John Williams, COO: Absolutely Sarah. So we're on track with our branch consolidation - we'll close 150 branches this year and another 200 next year. This will generate approximately $400 million in annual cost savings by 2025. We're reinvesting about half of that into our digital channels. Our digital adoption rate has reached 72% which is, you know, ahead of our 70% target for this year.

  David Lee, Barclays: Thanks. Um, could you walk us through your thinking on the provision build this quarter? It seems higher than peers.

  Jane Doe, CFO: Sure, David. So, um, let me give you the full context here because I think it's important to understand our methodology. We took a provision of $850 million this quarter, and there are really three components driving that. First, about $300 million is related to our commercial real estate portfolio, specifically office properties in major urban centers where we're seeing continued stress from work-from-home trends. We've been very conservative here because we think the recovery will be slower than many expect. Second, we have $400 million related to our consumer portfolio, and this is really about normalization - we're still below pre-pandemic levels but we're seeing the expected increase in delinquencies as government support programs have ended. And then the remaining $150 million is what I'd call prudent overlay given the macro uncertainty - we're seeing mixed signals on recession risk and we'd rather be conservative here. Now, if you compare this to peers, you're right that it's higher, but I think you have to look at our mix of business - we have more exposure to commercial real estate than most of our peers, about 15% of our loan book versus 10% industry average, and we've always taken a more conservative approach to provisioning which has served us well historically.

  David Lee: Right, okay, that makes sense.

  Jane Doe, CFO: And just to add one more point - our coverage ratio is now at 2.8%, which gives us a very strong buffer, and we think that positions us well for whatever economic scenario unfolds.

  - Maintain chronological order
  - Don't combine their responses

  Unclear audio:
  - Use [Inaudible] inline where needed
  - Continue formatting the rest

  Already contains HTML:
  - Preserve existing valid HTML tags

  Very long responses:
  - Can break into multiple paragraphs for the same speaker
  - Repeat speaker identification if breaking: <b>Jane Doe</b> (CFO) continued: ...

  Interruptions or clarifications:
  - Include both speakers with proper formatting
  - Use natural flow, not timestamps
