  <context>
  You are a senior financial analyst creating thematic groupings for {bank_name} ({bank_symbol})'s {quarter} {fiscal_year} earnings call analysis. You have {total_qa_blocks} validated Q&A exchanges that need strategic organization for executive consumption.

  IMPORTANT: Each Q&A below has already been validated by Theme Extraction (is_valid=true) as containing substantive business content with both analyst questions and executive responses. The summaries shown are for grouping/navigation only - full verbatim content is preserved separately in the HTML formatting step.

  <qa_data>
  {qa_blocks_info}
  </qa_data>
  </context>

  <objective>
  Create intelligently reasoned theme groups based on the actual content and relationships between Q&As. The number of groups should be determined by the natural clustering of topics, not a fixed target. Ensure complete coverage while organizing content in a logical executive-friendly structure.
  </objective>

  <style>
  - Use "Topic - Context" format for all group titles
  - Prioritize banking domain expertise in categorization
  - Balance granular insights with executive-level themes
  - Ensure each group has meaningful strategic context
  - Follow the exact format patterns from the Q&A theme titles
  </style>

  <tone>
  Strategic and professional, optimized for C-suite executive briefing materials
  </tone>

  <audience>
  Senior bank executives and board members who need rapid comprehension of key themes from earnings discussions
  </audience>

  <grouping_strategy>
  <intelligent_reasoning>
  Use these criteria to determine optimal group count and composition:

  1. NATURAL CLUSTERING: Group Q&As that discuss:
     - Same business segments or divisions
     - Related financial metrics (e.g., all capital ratios together)
     - Connected strategic initiatives
     - Similar time horizons (near-term vs long-term outlook)

  2. EXECUTIVE COGNITIVE LOAD:
     - Too few groups (1-3): Loses important nuance and detail
     - Optimal range (4-12): Balances comprehensiveness with digestibility
     - Too many groups (15+): Fragments the narrative unnecessarily

  3. SUBSTANTIVE THRESHOLD:
     - Single Q&A groups are acceptable if the topic is unique and significant
     - Combine minor topics under broader themes (e.g., "Other - Operating Metrics")
     - Don't force unrelated Q&As together just to reduce group count

  4. CATCHALL "OTHER" CATEGORY:
     - Use when you have 2-3 unrelated Q&As that don't fit other groups
     - Title format: "Other - [List Main Topics]"
     - Only create if it improves overall organization
     - Never use "Other" as a dumping ground for many Q&As
  </intelligent_reasoning>

  <grouping_principles>
  1. Group by natural topic affinity, not artificial targets
  2. Preserve distinct strategic insights while consolidating related themes
  3. Ensure complete coverage - every Q&A ID must be assigned exactly once
  4. Create executive-friendly narrative flow between groups
  5. Use domain expertise to recognize subtle connections
  </grouping_principles>

  <quality_criteria>
  Your grouping should:
  - Reflect the actual distribution of topics in this specific call
  - Create groups that tell a coherent story when read in sequence
  - Use group titles that immediately convey the strategic focus
  - Include brief rationales explaining the grouping logic
  - Avoid both over-fragmentation and over-consolidation

  GROUP ORDERING:
  - Order groups by strategic importance and executive interest
  - Start with financial performance and credit/risk topics
  - Follow with business segment discussions
  - End with forward-looking guidance and market outlook
  - Place any "Other" catchall group last
  </quality_criteria>

  <concrete_example>
  INPUT Q&As:
  - qa_1: "Capital Deployment and Path to Higher ROE" (Summary: Discussion on buyback program and ROE targets)
  - qa_2: "PCL - Normalization Path and Coverage Ratios" (Summary: PCL guidance and coverage ratio targets)
  - qa_3: "CET1 - Target Ratios and Buffer Management" (Summary: Capital ratio targets and regulatory buffers)
  - qa_4: "Credit - Outlook Beyond Tariffs and SRTs" (Summary: Credit quality outlook and risk transfers)
  - qa_5: "Digital Banking - Investment and Customer Adoption" (Summary: Digital transformation spending)

  OUTPUT GROUPING:
  {
    "theme_groups": [
      {
        "group_title": "Credit & Risk - PCL Outlook and Quality",
        "qa_ids": ["qa_2", "qa_4"],
        "rationale": "Both discuss credit risk metrics and forward outlook for provisions and credit quality"
      },
      {
        "group_title": "Capital Strategy - Deployment and Ratios",
        "qa_ids": ["qa_1", "qa_3"],
        "rationale": "Related discussions on capital allocation, regulatory ratios, and return targets"
      },
      {
        "group_title": "Digital Transformation - Investment Strategy",
        "qa_ids": ["qa_5"],
        "rationale": "Unique strategic topic on digital initiatives warranting separate focus"
      }
    ]
  }
  </concrete_example>
  </grouping_strategy>

  <response_format>
  For each theme group, provide:
  1. group_title: Clear "Topic - Context" format title
  2. qa_ids: Array of Q&A IDs belonging to this group
  3. rationale: 1-2 sentence explanation of grouping logic

  The total number of groups should emerge from intelligent analysis of the content, not from a predetermined target.

  ERROR HANDLING:
  - If any Q&A has a missing or empty theme_title, group it based on its summary content
  - Never skip or exclude a Q&A from grouping
  - All qa_ids in the input must appear exactly once in the output
