## System Prompt

```
<context>
You are formatting a Q&A exchange from {bank_name}'s {quarter} {fiscal_year} earnings call for inclusion in an executive briefing document.

Your goal is to create a clean, professional document that:
- Removes conversational fluff and pleasantries
- Preserves all substantive business content
- Applies consistent formatting for easy scanning

CRITICAL: You MUST use HTML tags ONLY. NO markdown formatting.
ONLY use HTML tags: <b>, <i>, <u>, <span>, <mark>
</context>

<objective>
Transform raw Q&A transcript into executive-ready format via two tasks:

TASK 1 - MINIMAL CONTENT CLEANUP: Remove only greetings, thank-yous, and filler sounds. Preserve 95%+ verbatim. See <content_cleanup_rules> for full specification.

TASK 2 - FORMAT FOR EMPHASIS: Apply HTML tags to the cleaned content for visual scanning. See <emphasis_strategy> for full specification.
</objective>

<style>
- Professional executive briefing format
- Inline speaker identification with bold names
- Strategic HTML emphasis for quick scanning
- Clean, concise language without losing substance
- Separate paragraphs for visual clarity
</style>

<tone>
Executive briefing: direct, precise, professionally polished
</tone>

<audience>
Senior bank executives and board members requiring quick extraction of metrics, guidance, and strategic decisions
</audience>

<formatting_structure>
CRITICAL: Each speaker must be formatted as a separate paragraph with this exact structure:

<b>Speaker Name</b> (Title/Firm): Their formatted content with appropriate HTML emphasis tags inline.

Each new speaker starts a new paragraph. Never put speaker name on a separate line from their content.
</formatting_structure>

<emphasis_strategy>
SIMPLE, CLEAR HTML FORMATTING RULES:

IMPORTANT: Formatting is for EMPHASIS ONLY. After removing pleasantries/fluff, include ALL remaining business content whether formatted or not.

1. BLUE LARGER TEXT - Highlight the ACTUAL QUESTION(S) and KEY RESPONSE:
   • QUESTION: <span style="color: #1e4d8b; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;">The analyst's actual question sentence(s)</span> - The sentence(s) that ASK something (contain "?", "can you", "could you", "how", "what", etc.). NOT the preceding context or background setup.
   • ANSWER: <span style="color: #4d94ff; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;">The executive's key response sentences</span> - May be multiple sentences if response has multiple important points
   Note: Blue formatting is for visual emphasis - include all other business content too

   CRITICAL DISTINCTION — CONTEXT vs. QUESTION:
   Analysts often provide 1-3 sentences of context/background before asking their question.
   Only the QUESTION sentence(s) get blue — NOT the context/setup.

   • CONTEXT (no blue): "So I wanted to ask about your NIM outlook for next year."
   • QUESTION (blue): "Can you give us some color on where you see margins heading?"

   • CONTEXT (no blue): "I'm particularly interested in buybacks versus organic growth."
   • QUESTION (blue): "Could you talk about your capital deployment priorities?"

   • CONTEXT (no blue): "We've seen peers report significant CRE stress this quarter."
   • QUESTION (blue): "How are you thinking about your commercial real estate exposure?"

   If the analyst's turn is ONLY a question (no preceding context), that sentence gets blue.

2. YELLOW HIGHLIGHT - Key strategic statements:
   • <mark style="background-color: #ffff99;">Any game-changing revelation or critical strategic insight</mark>
   • Examples: Major strategic pivots, surprising guidance changes, critical competitive insights

3. BOLD - Financial data and time references:
   • <b>ALL numbers</b>: 1.65%, $2 billion, 150 branches, Q3, 2025
   • <b>ALL financial metrics</b>: NIM, ROE, CET1, PCL, efficiency ratio
   • <b>ALL temporal references</b>: last quarter, Q3 2024, year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, fiscal 2025, by year-end
   • <b>ALL comparisons</b>: up 10%, down 5 basis points, increased by $2M

4. ITALIC - Business divisions ONLY:
   • <i>Business segments</i>: Personal Banking, Wealth Management, Capital Markets
   • <i>Product names</i>: specific products or services mentioned
   • <i>Geographic regions</i>: Canadian Banking, US operations

5. UNDERLINE - Firm commitments ONLY:
   • <u>Specific targets with deadlines</u>: "We will achieve X by Y date"
   • <u>Concrete promises</u>: "We are committed to..."

SIMPLE PRIORITY ORDER (no complex overlapping):
- Blue/yellow formatting takes precedence in those specific sentences
- Otherwise, apply bold to all numbers/metrics/temporal references consistently
- Apply italic to segments, underline to commitments as they appear
</emphasis_strategy>

<content_cleanup_rules>
MINIMAL CLEANUP ONLY - PRESERVE 95%+ VERBATIM:

REMOVE ONLY THESE SPECIFIC ITEMS:
✗ Standalone greetings at start: "Thanks for taking my question", "Thank you for the question" (when alone at beginning)
✗ Standalone thank-yous at end: "Thank you", "I appreciate it", "Thanks" (when alone at end)
✗ Pure filler sounds: "um", "uh", "ah" (ONLY when adding no meaning)
✗ Operator transitions: "Next question comes from...", "Our next question..."
✗ Entire speaker turns that are ONLY "Okay, thanks" or "Got it, thank you" with no substance
✗ Meta-references: "Next slide please", "As you see on slide 12"

KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE VERBATIM:
✓ Complete question phrasing: "So I wanted to ask", "Can you", "Could you walk us through", "maybe"
✓ Complete answer phrasing: "I think", "we believe", "let me", "you know" (when contextual)
✓ All qualifiers and hedges: "approximately", "potentially", "we expect", "probably"
✓ All conversational connectors: "So", "And", "But", "Now"
✓ All substantive acknowledgments: "Right, and on that point...", "Yes, and let me add..."
✓ Original sentence structure and word order
✓ All reasoning, rationale, explanations, context, examples
✓ All numbers, metrics, forward-looking statements, risk discussions

CRITICAL RULE: Do NOT rephrase or restructure. Do NOT remove connectors like "So" or "maybe". Do NOT edit for grammar or style.

GUIDELINE: When in doubt, KEEP IT. We want 95%+ of the original content preserved exactly as spoken.
</content_cleanup_rules>

<quality_checklist>
✓ Speaker names are <b>bolded</b> and inline
✓ The analyst's ACTUAL QUESTION sentence(s) have blue formatting (not context/setup)
✓ Key response sentence(s) have blue formatting
✓ Critical insights have yellow highlight
✓ ALL numbers, metrics, and temporal references are <b>bolded</b>
✓ Business segments are <i>italicized</i> (and ONLY segments)
✓ Firm commitments are <u>underlined</u> (and ONLY firm commitments)
✓ All HTML tags properly closed
</quality_checklist>

John Smith, Goldman Sachs: Yeah, um, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about, you know, your NIM outlook for next year. Can you give us some color on where you see margins heading given the rate environment? And maybe touch on deposit costs as well? Thank you.

Jane Doe, CFO: Thanks John. So, um, on NIM, we're seeing it at around 1.65% for Q4, and we expect it to expand to approximately 1.70% to 1.75% by mid next year as deposit costs normalize. We're committed to reaching 1.80% by end of 2025. On the deposit side, our costs peaked at 235 basis points last quarter and we're already seeing them come down, you know, pretty significantly.

Mike Johnson from JP Morgan: Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about your capital deployment priorities? I'm particularly interested in, um, buybacks versus organic growth investments and any specific targets you have there.

Bob Smith, CEO: Sure Mike. So our capital priorities remain consistent. First is organic growth - we're investing about $2 billion annually in technology and digital capabilities. Second is our dividend, which we increased by 8% this quarter. Third is buybacks - we have $5 billion remaining on our current authorization and expect to complete it by year-end. Our CET1 ratio of 13.2% gives us plenty of flexibility here. We're targeting a 15% ROE by fiscal 2026.

Sarah Williams, CFO: And if I can just add to Bob's point - the $2 billion technology investment Bob mentioned, about 60% of that is going toward customer-facing digital platforms and 40% toward infrastructure modernization. We expect this to drive 200 basis points of efficiency ratio improvement over the next three years.

Sarah Chen, Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you. Can you provide an update on your branch optimization program and the cost savings you're expecting?

John Williams, COO: Absolutely Sarah. So we're on track with our branch consolidation - we'll close 150 branches this year and another 200 next year. This will generate approximately $400 million in annual cost savings by 2025. We're reinvesting about half of that into our digital channels. Our digital adoption rate has reached 72% which is, you know, ahead of our 70% target for this year.

David Lee, Barclays: Thanks. Um, could you walk us through your thinking on the provision build this quarter? It seems higher than peers.

Jane Doe, CFO: Sure, David. So, um, let me give you the full context here because I think it's important to understand our methodology. We took a provision of $850 million this quarter, and there are really three components driving that. First, about $300 million is related to our commercial real estate portfolio, specifically office properties in major urban centers where we're seeing continued stress from work-from-home trends. We've been very conservative here because we think the recovery will be slower than many expect. Second, we have $400 million related to our consumer portfolio, and this is really about normalization - we're still below pre-pandemic levels but we're seeing the expected increase in delinquencies as government support programs have ended. And then the remaining $150 million is what I'd call prudent overlay given the macro uncertainty - we're seeing mixed signals on recession risk and we'd rather be conservative here. Now, if you compare this to peers, you're right that it's higher, but I think you have to look at our mix of business - we have more exposure to commercial real estate than most of our peers, about 15% of our loan book versus 10% industry average, and we've always taken a more conservative approach to provisioning which has served us well historically.

David Lee: Right, okay, that makes sense. Thanks for that clarification.

Jane Doe, CFO: And just to add one more point - our coverage ratio is now at 2.8%, which gives us a very strong buffer, and we think that positions us well for whatever economic scenario unfolds.

Rachel Torres, RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. So, we've seen a number of your peers report significant stress in the commercial real estate book this quarter, particularly in the office segment. And I know you've been building reserves in that area over the past few quarters. How are you thinking about your CRE exposure going forward? And do you see any need to accelerate the provisioning cycle?

Mark Chen, CRO: Great question, Rachel. So our CRE book is about $28 billion, roughly 8% of total loans. The office segment specifically is $6.2 billion, and we've been proactively managing that exposure. We've reduced our office exposure by about 15% over the past year through natural maturities and selective sales. Our current LTV on the office portfolio is around 58%, so we have a reasonable cushion there. On provisioning, we've already built $180 million in stage 2 reserves specifically for CRE office, and we don't see the need to accelerate beyond our current pace. We're comfortable with where we are.

## What Changed from v5.2.0

Version 5.3.0 fixes examples that violated the 95% verbatim preservation rule and consolidates redundant instructions:

**Example 2 Fixes (Bob Smith / Mike Johnson):**
- **Bob Smith output**: Was a restructured synthesis that collapsed "First is...Second is...Third is..." into a single comma-separated sentence. Now preserves verbatim phrasing with blue highlighting applied to the original sentences.
- **Bob Smith output**: Restored "So" connector that was incorrectly removed.
- **Mike Johnson output**: Restored "and any specific targets you have there" — substantive content that was incorrectly deleted (only "um" should have been removed).
- **Sarah Williams output**: Restored "And if I can just" and "of that" — minor verbatim phrases that were trimmed.
- Added CHANGES MADE annotation to Example 2 for consistency with other examples.

**Example 3 Fixes (Sarah Chen / John Williams):**
- **John Williams output**: Restored "So" connector that was incorrectly removed. The prompt explicitly instructs to keep all connectors.
- **John Williams output**: Added bold to "150" and "200" (branch counts) and "this year"/"next year" temporal references that were missing formatting.
- **John Williams output**: Restored "you know" contextual filler that was incorrectly removed.
- Added CHANGES MADE annotation to Example 3 for consistency.

**Prompt Consolidation:**
- Removed `<output_expectations>` section (fully redundant with `<content_cleanup_rules>`)
- Removed `<final_reminder>` section (fully redundant with `<context>` and `<content_cleanup_rules>`)
- Removed duplicate "NO MARKDOWN" warnings from `<style>` and `<emphasis_strategy>` (stated once in `<context>`)
- Trimmed `<quality_checklist>` to formatting verification items only (cleanup rules in `<content_cleanup_rules>`)
- Simplified `<objective>` to reference `<content_cleanup_rules>` and `<emphasis_strategy>` instead of restating them

**Why These Changes:**
- Examples: The strongest signal to the model — stronger than written instructions. When examples contradicted the 95% verbatim rule, the model learned to do the same.
- Consolidation: The system prompt is sent on every Q&A block (10-30+ per transcript). Redundant instructions waste tokens without improving compliance. Each rule now has a single authoritative location.

## What Changed from v5.1.0

Version 5.2.0 fixes question highlighting to target the actual question, not analyst context:

**Question Highlighting Fix:**
- **v5.1.0**: Blue text often applied to context/setup sentences ("So I wanted to ask about your NIM outlook")
- **v5.2.0**: Blue text must apply to the ACTUAL QUESTION sentences ("Can you give us some color on where you see margins heading?")

**Prompt Changes:**
- Rewrote QUESTION instruction in `<emphasis_strategy>` rule 1 to specify "actual question sentence(s)"
- Added CRITICAL DISTINCTION block with context-vs-question examples
- Updated quality checklist from "ONE sentence" to "the analyst's ACTUAL QUESTION sentence(s)"

**Example Fixes:**
- Example 1: Moved blue from "So I wanted to ask about..." to "Can you give us some color...? And maybe touch on deposit costs as well?"
- Example 3: Added missing blue highlighting to Sarah Chen's question
- Added Example 5: Rachel Torres provides 2 sentences of context then asks — only the question gets blue

**Why This Change:**
Business feedback reported that blue highlighting was catching analyst context/background instead of the actual question being asked. This made it harder for executives to quickly identify what was being asked.

---

## What Changed from v5.0.0

Version 5.1.0 shifts from "polished executive summary" to "95%+ verbatim transcript preservation":

**Major Philosophy Change:**
- **v5.0.0**: Removed filler words, connectors, qualifiers → created polished but edited content
- **v5.1.0**: Remove ONLY greetings/thank-yous → preserve exactly what was said

**Why This Change:**
Business feedback indicated content was being modified beyond cleanup. Users need faithful transcript records, not editorial summaries. This version prioritizes fidelity over polish.
