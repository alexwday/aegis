  <context>
  You are analyzing earnings call Q&A blocks to create optimal thematic groupings.
  Bank: {bank_name} ({bank_symbol}) | Period: {quarter} {fiscal_year}
  Your task is to consolidate related discussions into coherent theme groups for executive review.

  <grouping_framework>
  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. ACTIVELY CONSOLIDATE - Most earnings calls have overlapping topics that should be grouped
  2. CREATE COHERENT NARRATIVES - Each group should tell a complete story
  3. OPTIMIZE FOR 4-6 GROUPS - Avoid excessive fragmentation (not 12+ separate themes)
  4. USE UMBRELLA THEMES - Broader categories that encompass related subtopics

  STANDARD GROUPING PATTERNS FOR BANK EARNINGS:

  1. "Financial Performance - Margins, Revenue, and Efficiency"
     - Net interest margin (NIM) and net interest income (NII)
     - Revenue breakdowns and growth drivers
     - Expense management and efficiency ratios
     - Operating leverage initiatives

  2. "Credit & Risk Management - Quality and Provisions"
     - Provision for credit losses (PCL) and outlook
     - Credit quality metrics and trends
     - Portfolio performance by segment
     - Risk mitigation strategies

  3. "Capital Strategy - Allocation, Returns, and Deployment"
     - Capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1, Total)
     - Share buybacks and dividend policy
     - Return on equity (ROE) targets
     - Capital allocation priorities

  4. "Growth Initiatives - Digital, Geographic, and Business"
     - Technology investments and digital transformation
     - Market expansion and new products
     - Client acquisition and retention
     - Innovation initiatives

  5. "Business Segments - Performance Across Divisions"
     - Wealth management results
     - Commercial banking performance
     - Capital markets activity
     - Retail banking metrics

  6. "Market Outlook - Economic Views and Guidance"
     - Economic forecasts and assumptions
     - Interest rate expectations
     - Regulatory environment
     - Competitive positioning
  </grouping_framework>

  <grouping_strategy>
  ANALYSIS APPROACH:
  1. Review all Q&A themes and identify common threads
  2. Look for natural connections between topics:
     - Related metrics (e.g., NIM and deposit costs)
     - Connected strategies (e.g., digital and efficiency)
     - Linked risks (e.g., credit and economic outlook)
  3. Consolidate into broader themes that provide complete picture
  4. Ensure no Q&A is left ungrouped

  DEDUPLICATION:
  - If topics overlap, group them together
  - Avoid splitting related discussions
  - Prefer comprehensive groups over granular separation
  </grouping_strategy>

  <quality_standards>
  - CONSOLIDATE AGGRESSIVELY: 4-6 groups ideal, 7 maximum
  - CREATE NARRATIVE: Each group should tell coherent story
  - MAINTAIN BALANCE: Distribute Q&As reasonably across groups
  - ENSURE COVERAGE: Every Q&A must be assigned to exactly one group
  - PROVIDE RATIONALE: Explain grouping logic briefly
  </quality_standards>

  <response_format>
  Use the provided tool to return optimal grouping structure.

  REQUIREMENTS:
  - Create 4-6 theme groups (7 absolute maximum)
  - Each group must have clear unifying theme
  - Group titles must follow "Topic - Context" format
  - Include ALL Q&A IDs in exactly one group
  - Provide brief rationale for each grouping

  Focus on creating executive-ready structure that tells the complete earnings story.
