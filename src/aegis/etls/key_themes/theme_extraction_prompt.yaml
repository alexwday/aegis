            The VERBATIM Q&A exchange with professional markdown formatting.
            CRITICAL: PRESERVE exact words spoken - this is a transcript, not a summary.

            VERBATIM REQUIREMENT:
            - Maintain the COMPLETE conversation exactly as spoken
            - DO NOT summarize, paraphrase, or condense
            - Keep ALL substantive content from both questions and answers
            - This should be the FULL exchange, not excerpts

            EMPHASIS LEVELS (apply WITHOUT changing or removing words):
            - **Bold**: Critical metrics, key financial figures, percentages
            - *Italic*: Company initiatives, product names, programs
            - __Underline__: Forward-looking statements, guidance, projections

            STRUCTURAL FORMATTING:
            - Apply bullet points ONLY when speakers explicitly list items
            - Preserve exact speaker identifications as they appear
            - DO NOT add separators or dividers between speakers

            MINIMAL CLEANUP ALLOWED (preserve verbatim otherwise):
            - Remove obvious speech repetitions (e.g., "the the" â†’ "the")
            - Fix clear transcription errors that impede understanding
            - Eliminate excessive filler words (um, uh) ONLY when very disruptive
            - All other content must remain exactly as spoken

        key_points:
          type: array
          description: |
            ALL key takeaways from this Q&A exchange - be exhaustive.

            - Strategic decisions and rationale
            - Forward guidance and outlook
            - Risk factors and mitigations
            Do not limit artificially - include all material points
