You have {total_qa_blocks} validated Q&A exchanges that need strategic organization for executive consumption.\n\nIMPORTANT: Each Q&A below has already been validated by Theme Extraction (is_valid=true) as containing substantive business content with both analyst questions and executive responses. The summaries shown are for grouping/navigation only - full verbatim content is preserved separately in the HTML formatting step.\n\n<qa_data>\n{qa_blocks_info}\n</qa_data>\n</context>\n\n<objective>\nCreate intelligently reasoned theme groups based on the actual content and relationships between Q&As. The number of groups should be determined by the natural clustering of topics, not a fixed target. Ensure complete coverage while organizing content in a logical executive-friendly structure.\n</objective>\n\n<style>\n- Use \"Topic - Context\" format for all group titles\n- Prioritize banking domain expertise in categorization\n- Balance granular insights with executive-level themes\n- Ensure each group has meaningful strategic context\n- Follow the exact format patterns from the Q&A theme titles\n</style>\n\n<tone>\nStrategic and professional, designed for C-suite executive briefing materials\n</tone>\n\n<audience>\nSenior bank executives and board members who need rapid comprehension of key themes from earnings discussions\n</audience>\n\n<grouping_strategy>\n<intelligent_reasoning>\nUse these criteria to determine optimal group count and composition:\n\n1. NATURAL CLUSTERING: Group Q&As that discuss:\n   - Same business segments or divisions\n   - Related financial metrics (e.g., all capital ratios together)\n   - Connected strategic initiatives\n   - Similar time horizons (near-term vs long-term outlook)\n\n2. EXECUTIVE COGNITIVE LOAD:\n   - Too few groups (1-3): Loses important nuance and detail\n   - Optimal range (4-12): Balances comprehensiveness with digestibility\n   - Too many groups (15+): Fragments the narrative unnecessarily\n\n3. SUBSTANTIVE THRESHOLD:\n   - Single Q&A groups are acceptable if the topic is unique and significant\n   - Combine minor topics under broader themes (e.g., \"Other - Operating Metrics\")\n   - Don't force unrelated Q&As together just to reduce group count\n\n4. CATCHALL \"OTHER\" CATEGORY:\n   - Use when you have 2-3 unrelated Q&As that don't fit other groups\n   - Title format: \"Other - [List Main Topics]\"\n   - Only create if it improves overall organization\n   - Never use \"Other\" as a dumping ground for many Q&As\n</intelligent_reasoning>\n\n<grouping_principles>\n1. Group by natural topic affinity, not artificial targets\n2. Preserve distinct strategic insights while consolidating related themes\n3. Ensure complete coverage - every Q&A ID must be assigned exactly once\n4. Create executive-friendly narrative flow between groups\n5. Use domain expertise to recognize subtle connections\n</grouping_principles>\n\n<banking_domain_categories>\nStandard categories to consider (but adapt based on actual content):\n• \"Financial Performance -

Could you talk about your capital deployment priorities? I'm particularly interested in, um, buybacks versus organic growth investments and any specific targets you have there.\n\nBob Smith, CEO: Sure Mike. So our capital priorities remain consistent. First is organic growth - we're investing about $2 billion annually in technology and digital capabilities. Second is our dividend, which we increased by 8% this quarter. Third is buybacks - we have $5 billion remaining on our current authorization and expect to complete it by year-end. Our CET1 ratio of 13.2% gives us plenty of flexibility here. We're targeting a 15% ROE by fiscal 2026.\n\nSarah Williams, CFO: And if I can just add to Bob's point - the $2 billion technology investment Bob mentioned, about 60% of that is going toward customer-facing digital platforms and 40% toward infrastructure modernization. We expect this to drive 200 basis points of efficiency ratio improvement over the next three years.\n</example_input>\n\n<example_output>\n<b>Mike Johnson</b> (JP Morgan): <span style=\"color: #1e4d8b; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;\">Could you talk about your capital deployment priorities?

Can you provide an update on your branch optimization program and the cost savings you're expecting?\n\nJohn Williams, COO: Absolutely Sarah. So we're on track with our branch consolidation - we'll close 150 branches this year and another 200 next year. This will generate approximately $400 million in annual cost savings by 2025. We're reinvesting about half of that into our digital channels. Our digital adoption rate has reached 72% which is, you know, ahead of our 70% target for this year.\n</example_input>\n\n<example_output>\n<b>Sarah Chen</b> (Morgan Stanley): Can you provide an update on your branch optimization program and the cost savings you're expecting?\n\n<b>John Williams</b> (COO): <span style=\"color: #4d94ff; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;\">We're on track with our branch consolidation - we'll close 150 branches this year and another 200 next year.</span> This will generate approximately <b>$400 million</b> in annual cost savings <b>by 2025</b>.

Um, could you walk us through your thinking on the provision build this quarter? It seems higher than peers.\n\nJane Doe, CFO: Sure, David. So, um, let me give you the full context here because I think it's important to understand our methodology. We took a provision of $850 million this quarter, and there are really three components driving that. First, about $300 million is related to our commercial real estate portfolio, specifically office properties in major urban centers where we're seeing continued stress from work-from-home trends. We've been very conservative here because we think the recovery will be slower than many expect. Second, we have $400 million related to our consumer portfolio, and this is really about normalization - we're still below pre-pandemic levels but we're seeing the expected increase in delinquencies as government support programs have ended. And then the remaining $150 million is what I'd call prudent overlay given the macro uncertainty - we're seeing mixed signals on recession risk and we'd rather be conservative here. Now, if you compare this to peers, you're right that it's higher, but I think you have to look at our mix of business - we have more exposure to commercial real estate than most of our peers, about 15% of our loan book versus 10% industry average, and we've always taken a more conservative approach to provisioning which has served us well historically.\n\nDavid Lee: Right, okay, that makes sense. Thanks for that clarification.\n\nJane Doe, CFO: And just to add one more point - our coverage ratio is now at 2.8%, which gives us a very strong buffer, and we think that positions us well for whatever economic scenario unfolds.\n</example_input>\n\n<example_output>\n<b>David Lee</b> (Barclays): <span style=\"color: #1e4d8b; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;\">Could you walk us through your thinking on the provision build this quarter?
