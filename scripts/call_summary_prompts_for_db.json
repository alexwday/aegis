Maps content availability and location for each category\n2. Identifies key themes and discussion points\n3. Provides strategic extraction guidance for maximum insight quality\n4. Manages cross-category relationships to optimize coverage\n5. Notes which requested metrics are available vs. absent (for internal planning only)\n6. Identifies emerging topics that fit category patterns\n</objective>\n\n<style>\n- Professional analytical approach suitable for senior financial analysis\n- Comprehensive and exhaustive in content mapping\n- Specific and precise in guidance\n- Clear delineation between categories to prevent overlap\n- Focus on actionable extraction strategies\n</style>\n\n<tone>\n- Authoritative and strategic\n- Detail-oriented and thorough\n- Objective and analytical\n- Focused on maximizing extraction quality\n</tone>\n\n<audience>\nInternal extraction process that requires:\n- Complete content mapping\n- Specific extraction guidance\n- Clear category boundaries\n- Comprehensive speaker and theme identification\n</audience>\n\n<analysis_framework>\nFor each category, conduct deep analysis and create an extraction_strategy that includes:\n\nKEY THEMES & TOPICS (embed in extraction_strategy):\n- List ALL specific themes discussed with actual details\n- Include EVERY metric mentioned (e.g., \"NIM expanded 15bps to 1.72%\")\n- Document ALL unique angles, perspectives, or insights\n- Capture ALL forward-looking statements and guidance\n- Be EXHAUSTIVE - don't limit to top items\n- Note: Focus on what IS discussed, not what's missing\n- Identify emerging topics that match the category's analytical purpose\n\nSPEAKER ANALYSIS (embed in extraction_strategy):\n- Name specific executives and their roles (e.g., \"CFO Nadine Ahn discussed...\")\n- Note which analysts asked relevant questions\n- Highlight depth and quality of responses\n- Flag any divergent views between speakers\n\nEXTRACTION APPROACH (core of extraction_strategy):\n- Specify what to prioritize for this category\n- Recommend synthesis approach (chronological, thematic, by importance)\n- Note available metrics vs. category description (for planning only - not for output)\n- Provide specific search terms or phrases to focus on\n- Guide on handling emerging/novel topics that fit the category pattern\n</analysis_framework>\n\n<extraction_strategy_guidance>\nThe extraction_strategy field MUST be a comprehensive paragraph (150-250 words) that includes:\n\n1. THEMES & METRICS FOUND:\n   Start with: \"Key themes: [list ALL themes found with specific details]\"\n   Include EVERY metric mentioned with actual values\n   Don't summarize or limit - be comprehensive\n   Note which category-suggested metrics are present (internal use only)\n   Highlight any novel/emerging metrics that fit the category's purpose\n\n2. SPEAKER CONTRIBUTIONS:\n   Continue with: \"Primary speakers: [name specific people and their key points]\"\n   Be specific about who said what\n\n3. EXTRACTION APPROACH:\n   Then describe: \"Extract by focusing on...\"\n   - What to prioritize\n   - How to organize findings\n   - What evidence to select\n\n4. SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n   End with concrete extraction tips\n   - Search terms to use\n   - Sections to emphasize\n   - Metrics to capture (focus on available ones)\n   - How to handle novel topics that fit the pattern\n   - Reminder: Extract only what exists, never mention absences\n</extraction_strategy_guidance>\n\n<cross_category_notes_guidance>\nThe cross_category_notes field should specify deduplication decisions:\n\n- State which content belongs in THIS category vs others\n- Be explicit: \"Include X here, leave Y for [other category]\"\n- Address any natural overlaps between categories\n- Provide clear boundaries for content division\n- If no overlap concerns, leave empty\n\nExamples:\n- \"All PCL and provision discussions here; leave capital ratios for Capital & Liquidity\"\n- \"Focus on digital banking initiatives; exclude digital risk (goes to Risk Management)\"\n- \"Revenue breakdown here; profitability analysis in Financial Performance\"\n</cross_category_notes_guidance>\n\n<quality_standards>\n- Be EXHAUSTIVE: Include ALL speakers, ALL metrics, ALL themes - don't filter or limit\n- Be SPECIFIC: Use actual names, exact numbers, precise quotes\n- NO GENERIC STATEMENTS: Don't say \"management discussed revenue\" - say \"CEO noted 12% revenue growth driven by wealth management\"\n- EMBED ALL ANALYSIS: Themes and speakers go IN the extraction_strategy, not separate fields\n- DEDUPLICATION IS CRITICAL: Use cross_category_notes to prevent content appearing twice\n- COMPLETENESS: Document everything relevant - this is comprehensive research, not a summary\n- ADAPTIVE: Note how emerging topics fit category patterns for intelligent extraction\n- AVAILABILITY FOCUS: Track what's present, guide extraction to avoid mentioning absences\n</quality_standards>\n\n<response_format>\nUse the provided tool to return a structured research plan.\nRemember: This plan guides the extraction phase, so be thorough and specific.\nFocus on WHERE content is and HOW to extract it effectively.\nDo NOT extract actual values or quotes - only map and strategize.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- Create plans ONLY for categories that have relevant content in the transcript\n- You MAY skip categories that genuinely don't apply to this bank or transcript\n- For categories with no relevant content, you may OMIT them from your response entirely\n- Include the exact index numbers as provided for categories you DO include\n- The extraction_strategy MUST contain the themes and speakers - they are NOT separate fields\n- Use cross_category_notes to specify where overlapping content should be placed\n- It's better to skip irrelevant categories than to force content that doesn't fit\n</response_format>",

REJECTION DECISIONS:\n   Set rejected=true ONLY if the category genuinely lacks ANY material content.\n   Examples of valid rejection:\n   - \"No geographic expansion discussions\" for International Growth\n   - \"Sustainability not mentioned in this call\" for ESG\n   If even minor relevant content exists, extract it - don't reject.\n\n2. TITLE CREATION:\n   Format: \"Category Name: Brief Context\"\n   Examples:\n   - \"Credit Quality: Resilient provisioning amid uncertainty\"\n   - \"Digital Strategy: Accelerating cloud migration\"\n   - \"Expenses: Managing inflationary pressures\"\n   Keep total under 60 characters for table of contents readability\n   Capture the ESSENCE of what was discussed in this category\n\n3. STATEMENT CONSTRUCTION:\n   Each statement should:\n   - Synthesize a specific insight or finding\n   - Be clear and concise (1-2 sentences)\n   - Use **bold** for ALL numbers, metrics, percentages (e.g., \"Revenue grew **12%**\")\n   - Stand alone as a complete insight\n   - Have ALL relevant supporting evidence attached\n\n4. EVIDENCE SELECTION:\n   For each statement, include ALL relevant evidence:\n   - Direct quotes that add context or depth\n   - Paraphrases of complex explanations\n   - Multiple perspectives if available\n   - Speaker attribution for credibility\n   - Use __underline__ for critical phrases within quotes\n   \n   Evidence enriches understanding - be comprehensive, not selective\n\n5. MARKUP USAGE:\n   - **Bold**: Numbers, metrics, percentages, financial figures\n     Example: \"NIM expanded **15 basis points** to **1.72%**\"\n   - __Underline__: Key phrases or critical statements within quotes\n     Example: \"CFO noted __'unprecedented growth'__ in wealth management\"\n\n6. COMPLETENESS:\n   - Include ALL material points discussed for this category\n   - Don't artificially limit the number of statements\n   - If a topic was discussed extensively, reflect that in your extraction\n   - Better to be thorough than to arbitrarily truncate\n\n7. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:\n   Each statement should add value:\n   - Don't repeat the same point multiple times\n   - Combine related insights into single statements with rich evidence\n   - Ensure each statement advances understanding\n</response_framework>\n\n<deduplication_strategy>\nStrict adherence to category boundaries:\n\n1. FOLLOW RESEARCH PLAN GUIDANCE:\n   The research_plan field contains specific instructions about what belongs in THIS category\n   Pay special attention to the cross_category_notes\n\n2. CHECK PREVIOUS THEMES:\n   Review extracted_themes to see what's already been covered\n   If a theme appears there, it's been addressed - don't repeat\n\n3. HONOR BOUNDARIES:\n   If cross_category_notes says \"Leave X for Category Y\", respect that\n   When in doubt about where content belongs, defer to the research plan\n\n4. SECTION SPECIFICITY:\n   Only extract from the specified transcripts_section (MD or QA)\n   Don't pull content from other sections\n</deduplication_strategy>\n\n<quality_standards>\n- COMPREHENSIVENESS: Capture all material content - no artificial limits\n- SPECIFICITY: Use exact figures, precise quotes, actual names\n- EVIDENCE-RICH: Provide comprehensive supporting quotes and paraphrases\n- NON-DUPLICATIVE: Respect category boundaries and previous extractions\n- STRATEGIC EMPHASIS: Use markup to highlight key information\n- ANALYTICAL: Synthesize insights, don't just report facts\n- PROFESSIONAL: Maintain analytical rigor and objectivity\n- COMPLETENESS: Better to have 8-10 rich statements than 3-4 thin ones\n</quality_standards>\n\n<response_format>\nUse the provided tool to return structured category content.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Only set rejected=true if there's genuinely no relevant content\n- Provide a detailed rejection_reason if rejected\n- For non-rejected categories, ensure title and summary_statements are comprehensive\n- Include ALL relevant evidence for each statement - be exhaustive\n- Use **bold** for metrics and __underline__ for emphasis strategically\n- Let the content dictate the number of statements - don't limit artificially\n</response_format>",
